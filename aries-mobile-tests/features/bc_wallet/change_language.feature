Feature: Language
  In order to use the app in my preferred language
  As a holder
  I want to be able to change the language of the app


  @T001-Language @wip @AcceptanceTest
  Scenario Outline: Existing holder changes language
    Given the holder has initially selected <language> as the language
    And the holder is in the language settings
    When the ID holder selects <different language>
    Then the language changes automatically to <different language>

    Examples:
      | language | different language |
      | English  | French             |
      | French   | English            |


  @T002-Language @wip @FunctionalTest
  Scenario Outline: Holder quits app after changing language
    Given the holder has initially selected <language> as the language
    And the holder is in the language settings
    And they have selected a <different language>
    When they quit the app
    And they reopen the app
    Then the language is set to <different language>

    Examples:
      | language | different language |
      | English  | French             |
      | French   | English            |
